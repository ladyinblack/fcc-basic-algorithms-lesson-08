### [Truncate a String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/truncate-a-string)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
We need to reduce the length of the string or **truncate** it if it is longer than the given maximum length specified and add `...` to the end.  If it is not that long then we keep it as is.


## HINTS
### Hint 1
Strings are immutable in JavaScript so we will need a new variable to store the truncated string.
### Hint 2
You will need to use the `slice()` method and specify where to start and where to stop.
